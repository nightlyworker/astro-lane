# Automating sports big talking points

For the casual sports fans with little spare time or have short attention spans - Key Moment Clips are a way to catchup on the weeks events by just watching the key moments. They can share with friends and never miss another viral or trending moment.

This will get customers back to the app as a daily habit.

### Scope

| Aspect | Answer                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| Time   | 8 weeks                         |
| Team   | 4 person cross functional team  |
| Role   | UX / Design / Prototype in code |
| Tools  | Miro / Figma / VS Code          |

### Process

Using DAZN's existing back-end clip generator API, I devised an auto-scrolling film-roll feature that sequentially highlights and plays all the key moments across multiple games and sports.
